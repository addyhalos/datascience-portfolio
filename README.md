# Addy Halos - Data Science Portfolio

## About

Hello, it's great to find you here! I am Addy, and it is very nice to meet you.

Before anything else, I'd like to thank you for your interest in looking at my page.

I'd like to give you an introduction to my background in data science. 

I have an extensive background in the ecommerce industry. I started out as a data analyst in the pioneer business intelligence team of Shopee Philippines. I saw the company grow from a one floor office to a multi-building company in a span of 2 years. During my time there, I was the first person assigned to work on adhoc reports and design new regular reports coming in from all departments of the company. As it grew, I took up supporting the marketing team while being part of the digital goods and vouchers category, which grew into a fintech company known today as SEAMoney.

I then moved on to LalaFood, then a sister company of Lalamove Philippines, which is still one of the top on-demand logistics company in the Philippines. There, I supported the products team, giving strategic insights for driving driver onboarding optimization and a plan to optimize driver hotspot creation for optimal order matching.

My last full time job was with Zoom2u, an ASX-listed company based in Sydney, Australia. Formally, I was their data analyst, but as the only data team professional in the company, I managed my own end-to-end reporting processes. This required setting up several ETL processes from third party tools used by the different teams, requiring knowledge of basic data engineering skills.

Today, I am freelancing, continually expanding my knowledge in all aspects of data science.

I made this repository to give you a taste of what I can do. Feel free to reach out if you have any clarifications!

Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
Code: Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb

Goal: To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

Description: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

Results: Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

Tech Store Sales Analysis
Goal: To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

Code: Tech Store Sales Analysis.ipynb

Description: The dataset contains a list of sales records. The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

Results: Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.

Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
Code: Data Cleaning Project Queries: Nashville Housing.sql

Description: The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.

Skills: DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

Technology: SQL Server

Covid 19 Data Exploration
Code: COVID Portfolio Project.sql

Description: The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

Skills: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

Technology: SQL Server

Legendary Pokémon Analysis
Goal: To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

Code: Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)

Description: The dataset contains a list of Pokémon. The records include their characteristics such as attack, defense, type and size. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing characteristics of different Pokémon.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

Technology: Tidyverse
